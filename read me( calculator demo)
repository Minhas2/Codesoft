# Arithmetic Operations Calculator

This is a simple Python program that allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers.

## How to Use

1. Run the Python script (`arithmetic_calculator.py`) in your preferred development environment or command line.
2. You will be prompted to enter two numbers.
3. Then, you will be asked to select an operation:
   - Enter `1` for addition
   - Enter `2` for subtraction
   - Enter `3` for multiplication
   - Enter `4` for division

The program will perform the selected operation and display the result.

**Note:** Division by zero is handled, so you won't encounter any errors when dividing by zero. If you attempt to divide by zero, the program will display an error message.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the program:Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 3
Select operation:

1 Addition

Enter choice (1/2/3/4): 1
