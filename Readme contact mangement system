# Contact Management System

The Contact Management System is a simple Python program that allows users to manage a list of contacts. It provides features to add, view, search, update, and delete contacts. Additionally, it allows for saving and loading contacts from a file to persist data across program executions.

## Features

1. **Add Contact:** Add a new contact with a name, phone number, email, and address.

2. **View Contacts:** Display a list of all saved contacts, including their names and phone numbers.

3. **Search Contact:** Search for contacts by name or phone number and view search results.

4. **Update Contact:** Modify the details of an existing contact.

5. **Delete Contact:** Remove a contact from the list.

6. **Save Contacts:** Save the current list of contacts to a JSON file for data persistence.

7. **Load Contacts:** Load contacts from a JSON file when the program starts, allowing you to continue working with your contacts.

## Usage

1. Run the program in a Python environment (Python 3.x is recommended).

2. Choose options from the main menu to perform various contact management tasks.

3. Contacts are saved to the "contacts.json" file and loaded when the program starts.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- The `json` module is used for data storage, and it is included in the Python standard library.

## File Structure

- `contacts.json`: The JSON file used for storing contact data.

- `contact_management.py`: The Python script that contains the Contact class and the main program logic.

## Additional Notes

- Please ensure that the `contacts.json` file is in the same directory as the Python script.

- The program handles invalid inputs with appropriate error messages to provide a smooth user experience.

- For any questions or issues, please feel free to contact the developer.
